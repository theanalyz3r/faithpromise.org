    <p>We're trying something new this weekend (during the 10am service only) and would like you to be a part. In an effort to reach out to first-time families, we want to mail a gift to a few of them. We'd love to mail every new family a gift, but right now it's not possible. That's where we need your help. When you're talking with new families, and you feel they're possibly looking for a church home, would you mind marking their registration card? A little check in the corner is fine.</p>
    <p>Here's some details...</p>
    <ul>
        <li>We have limited gifts, so marking their registration card does not guarantee they'll receive a gift (please don't mention it to them).</li>
        <li>For the families that do receive a gift, each kid will get a t-shirt, coloring book, and some other cool stuff. The parents will get a worship CD, and possibly another box containing some great stuff for a family night.</li>
        <li>If you write a thank you card to the family, it will be included in the package we mail them.</li>
        <li>We'll reach out to the parents in the same week with a phone call or text.</li>
        <li>There's no pressure to identify families that should receive a gift. Let the Holy Spirit lead you and choose a few families (if possible) that would be impacted by a really cool gift.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Thanks so much for your help! If you have questions please give me a call or text. My mobile number is 973-2311.</p>
