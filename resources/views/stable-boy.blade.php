    <p>Few stories have been told as many times as the birth of Jesus. Mary and Joseph traveled to Jerusalem because of a census, but when they arrived, there was no place for them to stay at the inn. And so Jesus was born in a stable and slept in a manger.</p>
    <p>But our familiarity with the story can keep us from seeing it with fresh eyes. We forget that the stable wasnâ€™t a symbol of Christmas but a barn; we forget that the manger was a feed trough for animals. We become so comfortable with the story that it loses its true impact.</p>
    <p>Filmed and acted by Faith Promise staff and volunteers, The Stable Boy is an adaptation of the Christmas story, reset into the early 1800s.</p>
