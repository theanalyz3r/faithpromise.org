    <p>Groups are an integral part of what we do as a church. We believe that sustained life change occurs as we are growing in a relationship with Christ. When we prioritize intentional relationships with others who are seeking Christ, we believe faith comes alive! Groups provide people with the opportunity to encounter God, embrace others, engage the world around us, and expand God's Kingdom through their groups. Our Group leaders help create environments for people to develop and grow in their relationship with Jesus Christ.</p>
    <p>Since our Group leaders play such an important role, we take great care when enlisting them. Please read through the Faith Promise Group Leader Qualifications/Expectations information to better understand the qualifications and responsibilities of a leader. If, after prayer and consideration, you are interested in pursuing group leadership, please click the link at the bottom of the list to complete the Group Leader Questionnaire. Once we receive your questionnaire, we will contact you to schedule a meeting. Should you have questions regarding any of the following information, please email us at <a href="mailto:groups@faithpromise.org">groups@faithpromise.org</a>.</p>
